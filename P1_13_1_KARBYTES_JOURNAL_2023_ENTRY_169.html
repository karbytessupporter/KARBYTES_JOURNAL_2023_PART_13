<p>Today (i.e. 13_MARCH_2023) I checked the WordPress administration dashboard for this website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) and saw that approximately 35% (i.e. <strong>2.1 gigabytes</strong>) of the allotted <strong>6 gigabytes</strong> of media storage for that WordPress account has been used to host my content. <span style="background:#ffff00">I will try to minimize how many images I upload for future blog posts in this website and I will try to make all of my future content as succinct, comprehensible, interesting, honest, and non-redundant as possible.</span></p>
